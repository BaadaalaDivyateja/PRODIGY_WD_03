# PRODIGY_WD_02 - Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

## Description

This project is part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The task involves building an advanced Tic-Tac-Toe web application with features including:

- **Manual Play and Bot Mode**: Play against another player or an intermediate-level bot.
- **Animated UI**: Winning cells glow with animations, and a red line appears upon winning.
- **Responsive Design**: The game board and scoreboards are fully responsive.
- **Interactive Scoreboard**: Automatically updates with the number of games won by each player and the total games played.
- **Switch Mode**: A switch allows toggling between manual play and playing against the bot.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game layout.
- **CSS**: For styling, animations, and responsive design.
